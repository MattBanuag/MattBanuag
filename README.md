# **Hey there ðŸ‘‹** 
I'm Matthew Banuag, a Software Developer student at the **Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology** in Winnipeg!
As a lifelong learning software developer, my aim is to create powerful and aesthetically pleasing websites that makes a user's life easier.
```JavaScript
let usersLifeEasy = false;
alert('INSERTING Matthew.....');
usersLifeEasy = true;
```
I enjoy learning new things everyday, all while holding a big pot of coffee. When I'm not programming, I usually like to go outside and
enjoy the fresh air or play the guitar for hours and hours.

Tech stack
--
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python
