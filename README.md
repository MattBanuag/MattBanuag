### My Coding Journey
The first programming language I learned, was PHP. And after printing "Hello World" on the screen numerous times, I was hooked. It felt like I had powers that no one else had. So I pushed on, creating web applications, playing with databases, and all the other fun stuff. I knew in my heart I wanted to be a programmer, but life had other plans. Somewhere along the line, I started to drift away from programming and focus on other things. But just last year, I finally decided to come back to what I loved doing, writing code.
